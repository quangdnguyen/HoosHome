Hoos Home is a web application to connect students with housing options. On the home page, you can search housing based on keywords and number of beds and baths. 

In the top navbar:
* BUY - Allows you to view existing properties
* SELL - Allows you to create a new listing (only is visible when a user is logged in)
* HELP – Takes you to our README.md
* LOGIN WITH GOOGLE – Go to the login page (Must use a virginia.edu email address or be Professor Sherriff)

On the listings page, you can look at the properties. At the top, there are filter and sort toggles that allows you to do the respective action on the houses according to properties like price and rating. If you want a more detailed view for a specific property, you can click “More Information” to view more information on each property.

On the properties’ individual page, you can view its description, available amenities, realtor contact info, website, and location. Additionally, you can see reviews left by others and even leave your own. The rating is the average of all of the reviews left on that individual listing but each rating is not displayed so that people may rate in complete honesty. 

On the create listing page, you fill out all of the form data and upload three appropriate pictures to create a new listing. If two or less pictures are uploaded than the remaining available spaces are defaulted as VSabres.
